# Tickets

Slice the spec into build tickets.

1. Read the spec.
2. Draft **tracer-bullet** slices: each cuts through every layer (UI, game logic, networking, tests) and ends demoable in a browser. The first slice is the thinnest end-to-end path; later slices widen it. Each fits one agent session. Slices that share no blocker can be built in parallel — mark them.
3. Show the draft as a numbered list — title, blocked by, what a player can do once it's merged — and ask: right granularity? right edges? Iterate until the user approves.
4. Publish in dependency order, blockers first: each an `sdd:build` sub-issue of the spec, with its blocked-by edges.
5. Show the frontier — the tickets buildable now. Stop.
